      <p>It falls in line with my dream job pretty well. I have always been someone who enjoyed soolving problems, logic and math. I started college as a chemical engineering major, but it wasnt the thing. I went out and got proffesional experience for awhile to try and find my place. 

        I have always enjoyed technology and figuring out how things work. I have been teaching myself basic coding on the side for a few months and fell in love. I am not quite sure what I want to do specifically, but I know that I have alot to learn and am excited to find exactly where I need to be.
